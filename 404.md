# Oh dear, this link isn't working. Guess I haven't coded this page yet!

Some of the links are out-of-date. If the URL says "javascriptlearner815.github.io/blog/", remove "blog/".

This is possibly because:

- You need to see my inane bits below this multitude of reasons for this error message.
- This page does not exist yet.
- This page is temporarily gone.
- I just created the page and GitHub Pages is still waking up for me right now.
- This page is at a different link. ([Redirection is yet to come, but I can still take notes from your emails.][email])
- You mistyped the URL.
- Copy-and-paste isn't working today.
- This link is broken!!!
- You have/haven't used a truncated URL.
- The content was moved.
- The content was deleted. Wrong button!
- I messed up a link. My bad! (See below.)
- You tried to learn about BrainF*** and got JavaScript instead.
- GitHub Pages (or your browser!) doesn't like you.
- Your kitten is somewhere else.
- Your puppy is somewhere else.
- You just like being here. Iunno.
- You forgot to save or run.

Use common sense. [If that still does not fix the problem, or you are sure that this is something that does not exist and should for various reasons (e.g. referenced page that does not exist, requested blog post from you, etc.), please email me here.][email]

[Also try drawing!][draw]

You can also [start your journey again][restart] to go through every blog post!

Just don't kill me, okay? I matter in the Mathematics, Computer Science, and Programming carrers!
