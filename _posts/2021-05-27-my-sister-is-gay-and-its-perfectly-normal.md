# My Sister Is Gay—And It's Perfectly Normal!

And not just my half sister. Anyone that's homosexual is sane—and you've probably been mean to them your entire life!

In this article I will talk about why heteronormativity and homophobia needs to stop—as well as people being non-binary.

*Please note that sexual orientation is not always relative to sex.*

## What Is Gay?

The term "Gay" is an alias for homosexual. It means that a person has attraction to their own sex, and that attraction is typically sexual.

Gay marriage was made licit in the US in 2015—that's probably why we all have a phobia of it.

## What Is Straight?

The term "Straight" is an alias for heterosexual. It means that a person has attraction to their opposite sex, and that attraction is typically sexual.

Straight marriage has been around since the start in belief. That is why we are usually taught heteronormativity and make jokes about gay people—especially men for some reason, probably because the term "men" is more popular than "women" due to it being the base of the mature object of a person along with their sex.

## What Is Bi?

The term "Bi" is an alias for bisexual. It means that a person has attraction to both binary sexes, and that attraction is typically sexual.

Bi marriage is not a specific thing—see the dates for both gay and straight marriage becoming licit in the US.

## What Is A(sexual, he...) Loner?

The term "Loner" is *sometimes* an alias for asexual. It means that a person does not like attraction, typically sexual attraction.

A more popular term for this is "Single", as long as sex is involved. Loners are single forever.

## What Is Non-Binary/Binary?

Being binary means you prefer being mentioned via gender-specific pronouns, e.g. he, him, his, his, ...; she, her, her, hers, .... The acro means you prefer being mentiond via neutral pronouns, e.g. they, them, their, theirs, .... My half sister and I are binary, but one of my half sister's friends is non-binary.

## -sexual

Of the tertiary sexual orientations.

## -normativity

Being thought of as the personal sexual orientation and normal, default, or preferred sexual orientation for anyone else, also thinking it is the only allowed form of marriage in some cases (usually only for "hetero-").

## -phobia

Being scared or detesting of.

## Why Do Most People Have Heteronormativity/Homophobia?

Most of us have inherited it from school, which could possibly be using old information. We don't think men can have husbands, or women can have wives. We're closed-minded. All of us. Even me, before my half sister gave me this amazing truth that I am telling you today.

## It's All About Preference

No matter your sexual orientation, you can still have a preference. Maybe you're bisexual but prefer men, or maybe you're she-homosexual but prefer men as your normal friends that aren't your best friends. It's all about preference.

## Conclusion

This information about sexual orientation is important—especially for children, whom have learned only straight marriage and not gay marriage. Share this link to your friends, and tell them to share it in a chain to their other friends.

A BIG thank you to my half sister, by the way, for telling me all this—including the first paragraph of this conclusion—in her literal car on a drive home! She's 18 years old, and moving in 2 weeks. And now, thanks to her, whenever you check back on your old, dusty Wii and check out your copy of *Just Dance 2014*, you can understand how the homosapien representing the singer of *I Kissed A Girl* could've ever been chosen to be a girl in the first place like it is now!

And my final words ARE..................

...My birthday is exactly half a year from now!
